I am a KTH doctoral student, working with Prof. [Aristides Gionis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=11JgipcAAAAJ) on signed graph mining and with Prof. [Alexandre Proutiere](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g5sya5cAAAAJ) on graph bandits. For the former, I work with explict pattern mining. For the latter, I focus on the computational aspect of combiantorial bandits.
